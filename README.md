Code for the paper "A Deep Ensemble Predictor for Identifying Anti-Hypertensive Peptides Using Pretrained Protein Embedding"

1. Overview 

This repository is containing a main implementation of our model.

2. Dataset

Our dataset takes the orgainized dataset from Manavalan et al.[13]. 

3. The Pretrained Protein Model 

The pretrained protein model we used in our model is UniRep, which is based on 1900 layers of long-/-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to try to predict the next amino acid through the previous amino acids predicted.
